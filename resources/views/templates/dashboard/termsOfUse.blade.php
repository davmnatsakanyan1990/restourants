                restaurant owners/representatives with access to restaurant business page. The advertisements published on the
                RestAdviser Platform are independent of the reviews recieved by such advertisers. We are a neutral platform and we
                don’t arbitrate disputes, however in case if someone writes a review that the restaurant does not consider to be true,
                the best option for the restaurant representative would be to contact the reviewer or post a public response in order
                to clear up any misunderstandings. If the Restaurant believes that any particular user’s review violates any of the
                RestAdviser’policies, the restaurant may write to us at neutrality@RestAdviser.com and bring such violation to our
                attention. RestAdviser may remove the review in its sole discretion if review is in violation of the Terms, or content
