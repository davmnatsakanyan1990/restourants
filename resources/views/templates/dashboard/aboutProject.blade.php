        <div class="subTitle">People use the internet to search for restaurants<div class="line"></div></div>
        <div class="subContent">In today’s Internet-connected world, when people are looking for someplace
            to eat, whether it is a rush or a planned event, they will most probably use a search engine to
            look for restaurants and takeaways. If your restaurant does not come up in the search results those
            customers will not become yours. Having your restaurant registered in a professionally designed
            website along with many others makes you more available for the potential customers and gives
            you an incredible credibility in their eyes.
